### 💡 What Is This?

This project aims to collect high-quality fan-made custom scenarios, and put them in a booklet styled like [The Rewritten Rule Book](https://github.com/Heegu-sama/Homm3BG).

### 🤔 Why?

Many scenarios are scaterred around different places.
They also have inconsistent formatting.
It's all easily fixed, if everything is put into a single booklet.

### 🛠️ How?

This is a communal effort.
This repository serves as a means to version the scenarios, and for the community to contribute changes.

### 💪 Contributing

#### 🗺️ Scenarios

Please open an issue if you'd like to add a scenario, or call out to us on [Archon Studio's Discord](https://discord.gg/wd8U5X68EU).
We prefer battle-tested and community-vetted ones.

#### 💻 Code

Do you have an idea how to improve the LaTeX code, document layout or design, GitHub workflows?
Great, please reach out, we'd love to hear from you.

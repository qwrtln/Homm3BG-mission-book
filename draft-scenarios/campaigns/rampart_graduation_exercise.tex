\begin{multicols*}{2}

\textbf{Author:} Tm335

\textit{Gelu is the youngest individual to ever graduate from the Forest Guard.
  He must pass one final test and then he will enter service under Lord Falorel: assemble the pieces to the Elixir of Life so the Deyjan lords can't destroy the precious combination artifact.
}

\textit{The Forest Guard is Erathia’s eyes and ears.
  We go where we are needed most and that is usually places difficult for traditional fighting forces to reach.
  We are shadows of the forest that see all and bring silent death with a single, unseen bowshot.
  You have done well in your training, Gelu, but now has come the time to take the final test.
  A small valley near Gaia's Crest will be the site of this trial.
  Clear the region of all the enemies to earn your place among the ranks of the Forest Guard.
  Good luck.

\subsection*{\MakeUppercase{Additional Rules}}

During this Scenario:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Gelu cannot surrender.
      Player 2 can surrender.
      If player 2 is defeated in Combat, lose 5 \svg{gold} and both Heroes gain a \svg{morale_negative} token.
      Player 2 Hero is then placed in any Town or Settlement you control, or on a Field adjacent to Gelu.
    \item Your Heroes do not gain Experience past Level 5.
    \item You cannot recruit a Secondary Hero.
    \item Enemy Heroes stay within their Towns. They do not move.
    \item At the Dragon Utopia location, your Hero fights the Gold Dragons Army.
    \item Gain 1 \svg{valuables} when you defeat an Enemy Hero Army.
    \item \textbf{The Obelisks at N3 and N5 are Two-Way Monoliths.}
      Entering one of these Fields transports your Hero to the other Field. \textbf{The Obelisks function only if both Necropolis and Inferno Faction Towns have been captured.}
    \item \textbf{Inferno Town contains a one-way Castle Gate} that will allow the Player to transport themselves to the Obelisk at N3. It works only if the N3 Obelisk was flagged.
  \item \textbf{Necropolis and Inferno Towns:} The Necropolis and Inferno Towns (on S1 and S6) MUST be attacked and captured in the same Round.
    The Round is determined by when either Map Tile S1 or S6 is entered.
    If this coordinated attack fails, Gelu will lose his cover, and all Enemy Towns will call for immediate reinforcements.
    Gelu is then defeated.

\subsection*{\MakeUppercase{The Story}}

\textbf{Exercise starts}

To pass this trial, you must defeat everyone in the land by whatever means necessary.
Good luck, cadet.
May the Light shine down upon you.

\textbf{A quiet trail}

The dark and foreboding trail is ominously quiet.
Suddenly you hear the hissing of hundreds of snakes.
Before you even get a chance to turn back, more than two dozen Medusae slither out and attack.

\textcolor{darkcandyapplered}{
\begin{itemize}
    \item Medusas remain in their spot on the Far Map Tile regardless of how the Map Tile is rotated after discovery.
    \item Combat with a Pack of Medusas requires no additional \svg{movement-red}.
    \item If a Neutral army is also present on this Map Tile, it must be battled separately after the Medusas are defeated.
\end{itemize}
}

\textbf{The raiders}

Forest Guard rangers must deal with a wide variety of unexpected and troublesome situations.
There will come times when things will not go as planned.
This is one of those times.
Several of your supply trains have been hit by raiders and their contents looted.
Deal with this situation.
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textcolor{darkcandyapplered}{Lose: 3~\svg{gold}, 1~\svg{building_materials}, 1~\svg{valuables}.}
  \item \textcolor{darkcandyapplered}{The difficulty level of every Combat encounter on all \textbf{Far Map Tiles increases by one} until the end of the Scenario} (see page 35, ``Field Difficulty Level Table'' in the Core Rulebook).  % no-check-caps
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Pandora's Box}

You receive an eerie feeling from the box before you.
A glow pulsates around it and an odd colored fog issues forth from its cracks.
\textcolor{darkcandyapplered}{
\begin{itemize}
    \item Start Combat with a Pack of Efreet and a Pack of Genies instead of the standard Neutral army.
    \item In addition to the Field reward, gain 1 \svg{valuables}.
\end{itemize}
}

\textbf{Continued raids}

If the Necropolis and Inferno Faction Towns have not been captured yet, raiders continue to disrupt your supply lines.

\textcolor{darkcandyapplered}{
Depending on the Round, lose from its income:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{\nth{9}}: 10 \svg{gold}
  \item \textbf{\nth{11}}: 20 \svg{gold}
  \item \textbf{\nth{13}}: 30 \svg{gold}
\end{itemize}

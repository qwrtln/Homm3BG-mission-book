\subsection*{\MakeUppercase{Map Setup}}
Take the following Map Tiles ($P$ stands for the number of players) and arrange them as shown in the Scenario map layout:

\begin{itemize}
  \item P × Starting (I) Map Tile
  \item 2P × Far (II-III) Map Tiles
  \item P × Near (IV-V) Map Tiles
  \item 6 × Near (IV-V) Map Tiles with Obelisk
  \item 1 × Center (VI-VII) Map Tile
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{\MakeUppercase{Victory Conditions}}
The game ends when any of the following conditions are met:

\begin{itemize}
  \item One player has defeated each of the other players' Main Heroes once. \textit{That player wins the game immediately.}
  \item One player has flagged all 6 Obelisks. \textit{That player wins the game immediately.}
  \item At the end of Round 15.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{\MakeUppercase{Victory Points}}
If no player has achieved an immediate victory, the player with the most Victory Points (VP) wins.

\begin{itemize}
  \item 4 VPs for the first player to flag the Center VII Field.
  \item 2 VPs for each enemy Main Hero defeated.
  \item 1 VP for each flagged Obelisk.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{\MakeUppercase{Timed Events}}

\end{itemize}

\end{itemize}
\textbf{\nth{8} Round:}

  \item Repeat the event of Round 4.
\end{itemize}
\textbf{\nth{10} Round:}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Player(s) whose Main Hero has the least \svg{experience}, gain 2 \svg{resource}.
\end{itemize}
\textbf{\nth{12} Round:}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Repeat the event of Round 4.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{\MakeUppercase{Additional Rules}}
\begin{itemize}
  \item The Blocked Field on the Map Tile in the center is not considered blocked.
  \item \textbf{Sanctuary:} Search (2) your Deck. \textit{Visitable once per Faction}.
  \item \textbf{Obelisk:} Guarded by Level VI Neutral Units. Search (2) \svg{skill}, \svg{spellpower} or \svg{artifact}. \textit{Can be flagged by all players.}
  \item Each \textbf{blocked Field} adjacent to an Obelisk is a two-way Astral Gate, which only becomes active after that Obelisk has been visited.
  \item \textbf{Astral Gate:} Cannot be entered from a different Map Tile. When a Hero enters an Astral Gate, they are teleported to the Astral Gate on the Near Tile directly opposite the Center Tile. If that Tile is undiscovered, that player immediately discovers it.
  \item Gain 1 \svg{experience} after a Combat against an enemy Main Hero, unless one of the players Surrenders or Retreats.
\end{itemize}

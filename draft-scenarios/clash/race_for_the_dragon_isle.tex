\subsection*{\MakeUppercase{Player Setup}}
\textbf{Player Count:} 2--7

\textbf{Starting Resources:} 15 \svg{gold}, 4 \svg{building_materials}, 1 \svg{valuables}

\textbf{Starting Income:} 10 \svg{gold}, 2 \svg{building_materials}, 1 \svg{valuables}

\textbf{Starting Units:}

\begin{itemize}
  \item 2 ×``Few'' of the cheapest \svg{bronze} Units

\textbf{Map Tile Pool:} Each player takes 2 random Far (II–III) and 2 random Near (IV–V) Map Tiles (one with Obelisk and one without).

\subsection*{\MakeUppercase{Map Setup}}
Take the following Map Tiles and arrange them as shown in the Scenario map layout ($P$ stands for the number of players):

\begin{itemize}
  \item P × Starting (I) Map Tile
  \item 6 × Center (VI–VII) Map Tile
  \item \#F10 Far Map Tile
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{\MakeUppercase{Victory Conditions}}
First player to start their turn while controlling a Dragon Utopia wins the game. If two players control the two Utopias at the end of Round 12, those players draw Cards up to their \svg{hand} Limit and engage in a final Combat. The winner of that Combat wins the game.

\subsection*{\MakeUppercase{Defeat Conditions}}
If no Dragon Utopia has been captured by the end of Round 12, all players lose.

\textbf{\nth{12} Round:}
\begin{itemize}

\end{itemize}

\subsection*{\MakeUppercase{Additional Rules}}
Map:
\begin{itemize}
  \item The Obelisk Map Tile must be the final Tile each player discovers.
  \item Turns are played simultaneously until the first player teleports to \#F10.
  \item First player to teleport becomes the first player for the remainder of the game.
  \item All players who teleport to \#F10 on the same turn as the first player (including the first player) lose all remaining \svg{movement}.
  \item Players cannot connect to another player's area.
  \item Blocked Fields on Starting Tiles count as inactive two-way Portals.
  \item The Obelisks on the Near Tiles are inactive two-way Portals.
  \item Each Obelisk is guarded by a Level VI Combat. When a player defeats that Combat, both of that player’s Portals become active.
\end{itemize}
Dragon Isle:
\begin{itemize}
  \item The Blocked \#F10 Field is a two-way Portal and a Sanctuary. Any number of players may occupy the Sanctuary simultaneously.
  \item Players may teleport from \#F10 only to their own Town.
  \item Draw only Dragons for \svg{golden} and \svg{azure} Units in Combats on the Dragon Isle.

\begin{itemize}
  \item 3 \svg{attack}, 1 \svg{defense}, 3 \svg{health_points}, 6 \svg{initiative}
  \item \svg{permanent} Ignore the Combat penalty against adjacent Units.
\end{itemize}

\svg{silver} Mature Dragon \svg{unit_flying}:

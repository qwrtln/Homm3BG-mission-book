%\textit{A valley where ancient dragons protect secrets long forgotten. Fight for power, claim the land, or perish like those before you.}

\textit{A valley of secrets long forgotten. Its heart belongs to the beasts of old, while its fringes lure the bold and the desperate. Fight for power, claim the land, or perish like those before you.}

% \textit{The valley calls to those who seek adventure and riches beyond imagination. Its heart is guarded by Dragons older than time, its edges lined with settlements of those who dare to claim a foothold in this perilous land. But there is no safety here—only the promise of power for those who fight, and the certainty of death for those who falter.}

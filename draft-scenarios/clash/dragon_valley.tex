\textit{A valley of secrets long forgotten. Its heart belongs to the beasts of old. Fight for power, claim the land, or perish like those before you.}

\subsection*{\MakeUppercase{Scenario Length}}
This Scenario plays out over 13 Rounds.

\subsection*{\MakeUppercase{Player Setup}}
\textbf{Player Count:} 2 -- 4

\textbf{Starting Resources:} 14 \svg{gold}, 2 \svg{building_materials}, 0 \svg{valuables}

\textbf{Starting Income:} 10 \svg{gold}, 0 \svg{building_materials}, 0 \svg{valuables}

\textbf{Starting Units:}

\begin{itemize}
  \item ``Few'' of chosen \svg{silver} Units
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Town Buildings:}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Each player may build the \svg{building_special_tent} building at a discount of 2~\svg{gold} and 2~\svg{building_materials}, \textbf{or} gain 4~\svg{gold}.
  \item Citadel, \textbf{or} \\
    Mage Guild and gain 2~\svg{valuables}.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Map Tile Pool:} Each player takes 3 Far (II–III) Map Tiles.

\subsection*{\MakeUppercase{Map Setup}}
Take the following Map Tiles ($P$ stands for the number of players) and arrange them as shown in the Scenario map layout:

\begin{itemize}
  \item P × Starting (I) Map Tile
  \item 2P × Near (IV–V) Map Tiles
  \item 1 × Center (VI–VII) Map Tile with a Dragon Utopia
  \item P × Center (VI–VII) Map Tiles
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Additionally, for 4 players:}
\begin{itemize}
  \item 1 × Center (VI–VII) Map Tile with a Dragon Utopia
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{\MakeUppercase{Victory Conditions}}
The game ends at the end of the Round when any of the following conditions are met:

\begin{itemize}
 \item \textbf{4 players:} One player has defeated every opponent's Main Hero at least once. \textit{That player wins the game immediately.}
 \item One player has conquered both Dragon Utopias. \textit{That player wins the game immediately.}
\end{itemize}

If at the end of Round 13 no player has achieved an immediate victory, the player controlling a Dragon Utopia wins.
If different players control the two Utopias, they each draw Cards up to their \svg{hand} Limit and engage in a final Combat -- the winner is the victor.
If no one controls a Dragon Utopia, all players lose.

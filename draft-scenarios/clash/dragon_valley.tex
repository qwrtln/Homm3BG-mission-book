\textit{A valley of secrets long forgotten. Its heart belongs to the beasts of old, while its fringes lure the bold and the desperate. Fight for power, claim the land, or perish like those before you.}

\subsection*{\MakeUppercase{Scenario Length}}
This Scenario plays out over 13 Rounds.

\subsection*{\MakeUppercase{Player Setup}}
\textbf{Player Count:} 2 -- 4

\textbf{Starting Resources:} 14 \svg{gold}, 4 \svg{building_materials}, 1 \svg{valuables}

\textbf{Starting Income:} 10 \svg{gold}, 0 \svg{building_materials}, 0 \svg{valuables}

\textbf{Starting Units:}

\begin{itemize}
  \item A Pack of cheapest \bronze\ Units
  \item A Few chosen \bronze\ Units
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Town Buildings:}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \bronze\ Dwelling
  \item Each player may build the \svg{building_special_tent} building at a discount of 4 \svg{gold} and 2 \svg{building_materials}.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{\MakeUppercase{Map Setup}}
Take the following Map Tiles ($P$ stands for the number of players) and arrange them as shown in the Scenario map layout:

\begin{itemize}
  \item P × Starting (I) Map Tile
  \item 3P × Far (II–III) Map Tiles
  \item 2P × Near (IV–V) Map Tiles
  \item P × Center (VI–VII) Map Tile
  \item 1 × Center (VI–VII) Map Tile with a Dragon Utopia
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Additionally, for 4 players:}
\begin{itemize}
  \item 1 × Center (VI–VII) Map Tile with a Dragon Utopia
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{\MakeUppercase{Victory Conditions}}
The game ends at the end of the Round when any of the following conditions are met:

\begin{itemize}
 \item One player has defeated each other player's Main Heroes once. \textit{That player wins the game immediately.}
 \item One player has conquered both Dragon Utopias. \textit{That player wins the game immediately.}
 \item At the end of Round 13.
\end{itemize}

If no player achieves immediate victory, the player controlling a Dragon Utopia wins.
If different players control the two Utopias, they each draw Cards up to their Hand Limit and engage in a final Combat -- the winner is the victor.
If no one controls a Dragon Utopia, all players lose.

\textbf{Author:} Wololoeren

\textit{The war had dragged on far too long. Armies were shattered, lands burned, and hope had dwindled to barely a whisper. At last, the rival lords agreed to set aside their grievances and forge an Accord — a fragile peace born of desperation.\\
Messengers rode beneath white banners, oaths were sworn, and for the first time in years, the clash of steel gave way to uneasy silence. Yet peace has its own enemies.\\
As the allied hosts gathered in the valley of Laren's Cross, dawn broke with the sound of horns — not of welcome, but of war.\\
Out of the mist, enemy armies struck with deadly precision. Someone had betrayed the Accord.\\Now, surrounded and outnumbered, the fate of your alliance lies in your hands. Stand together — or fall alone.}  % no-check-caps

\subsection*{\MakeUppercase{Additional Rules}}

\begin{itemize}
  \item For games with 1--3 players, only one player needs to fight each Timed Event Fight. The players may decide which eligible player will fight.
  \item For games with 4 or more players, \textbf{two players} must each fight a Timed Event Fight when the event occurs.
  \item Players are not eligible to fight a Timed Event Fight if they have already won more Timed Event Fights than another player, or if they have no Units.
  \item Defeating a Timed Event Fight grants a free \svg{morale_positive}.
  \item If a player is defeated in a Timed Event Fight, their Hero is sent back to their Town with no Units. The remaining Units must be defeated by another player. If no player is eligible to fight, players lose the Scenario.

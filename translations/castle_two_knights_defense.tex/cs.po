"The last time he'd seen his queen like this was when they were in Steadwick together, and he looked a little embarrassed as he was lost for words.\n"
"The two studied each other momentarily, silently checking on each other.\n"
"Rion thought she looked much older and weathered from the ordeal, but he was happy to see a twinkle in his queen's eyes again.\n"

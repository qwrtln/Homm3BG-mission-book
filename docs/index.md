# Local Setup

In order to contribute, you'll need a minimum of [LaTeX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaTeX) distribution, Inkscape ang git.
Please read the instructions for your operating system (or container).

=== "Windows"

    ### Windows

    #### Install required software

    Download and install the following:

     - [**MiKTeX**](https://miktex.org/) - a LaTeX distribution for Windows

     - [**Inkscape**](https://inkscape.org/) - while installing on Windows, make sure to tick `Add Inkscape to the System Path` option, if you're prompted with one

     - [**git**](https://git-scm.com/) to commit files to the repository

     - [**Perl**](https://www.perl.org/get.html) (optional but recommended) to use a build script

    Optionally, to edit the TeX files conveniently:

     - [**VSCode**](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download) with [**TeX Workshop extension**](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=James-Yu.latex-workshop), or

     - [**TeXstudio**](https://www.texstudio.org/), or

     - [**TeXworks**](https://www.tug.org/texworks/)

    #### GitHub Account

    If you don't have an account on GitHub, please [create one](https://github.com/signup) now.

    #### Fork and clone the repository

    In the Mission Book's [GitHub repository](https://github.com/qwrtln/Homm3BG-mission-book), click "Fork":

    ![fork](assets/fork.png)

    Go to your repositories in GitHub, open the forked Mission Book repository, click the green "Code" button, and copy the clone URL:

    ![fork](assets/clone.png)

    Open the git program you installed.
    Run this command:

    ```bash
    git clone <copied_url>
    ```

    A new directory titled `Homm3bg-mission-book` should appear now in your file explorer.

    #### Building the project

    In the git bash console, run this command:

    ```bash
    tools/build.sh -d
    ```

    This will build the draft scenarios book.
    If the build is successful, you are all set to start working on your scenario.

    ### MacOS

    You can install everything using Homebrew:

    ```

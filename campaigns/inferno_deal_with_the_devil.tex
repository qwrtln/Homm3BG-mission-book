\textit{Queen Catherine has liberated Steadwick.
A Kreegan envoy has been sent to the royal court asking for one million gold ransom in return for the captive we hold, King Roland Ironfist of Erathia.
They were unwilling to pay.
It appears they are going to attempt to rescue Roland.
We are deep within Eeofol.
We are Clan Kreelah.
They will never take our captive, and they will never take Kleesive.
Prepare for battle!}

Charging Armies \#1 and \#2 use the same AI Deck and Skill Deck. Reshuffle both Decks after Combat.

Both Artifact Cards of all Charging Armies are treated as Skills, and use the top ``less powerful'' effect on the Card.
The ``Sword of Hellfire'' will be used in attacks and retaliation attacks.
It is not used when attacking Walls or Gates, and remains in effect on the Unit.
If ``Shield of the Damned'' is drawn, it takes effect when any Charging Army Unit takes attack or retaliation damage.
If the AI Skill Card advises ``do it again'', the Artifact Cards are not played again immediately, but instead are played as soon as the next Unit is able to use them.

\end{itemize}

\textbf{\nth{3} Round:}
\begin{itemize}

\subsection*{\MakeUppercase{Additional Rules}}

During this ``Inferno'' Campaign Scenario, the following rules apply:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Your Main Hero can only travel in Inferno Map Tiles. You cannot enter any other Map Tile type.
  \item You cannot attack Enemy Charging Heroes. You can only defend against them while inside of Kleesive.
  \item Gain 3 \svg{gold} when you defeat a Charging Hero's Army.
  \item If an Enemy Charging Hero enters a Map Tile or Field that your Main Hero is on (exception is if you are in
    your Inferno city Kleesive), or if a charging Hero attacks Kleesive and you are not present in your city
    of Kleesive, you are immediately transported back to Kleesive, you lose any remaining Movement Points
    you have, lose 3 \svg{gold}, gain \svg{morale_negative}, and randomly discard 1 Card from your hand.
  \item Enemy Charging Heroes move only 2 MPs. The Final Charging Army moves 4 MPs. They take the shortest
    route to Kleesive. If you own a Mine in a Map Tile they enter, they will capture the Mine (but will not
    ``backtrack'' to do so), and then continue along the shortest route to Kleesive. They ignore everything
    else. They also make use of Stables 1 MP bonus.
  \item Enemy Charging Heros always move amongst each to not ``block'' each other's paths (thus slowing each
    other down). The Enemy Charging Hero that can get closest to Kleesive will move before any others.
  \item Castle and Rampart already have all Mines controlled in their territory (non-Inferno Map Tiles). Place enemy
    Cubes on all of their Mines.
  \item Your Walls, Gates, and Arrow Tower in Kleesive are completely rebuilt after each battle.
  \item Enemy \svg{unit_flying} Units will fly over Walls and Gates to attack your Units whenever possible.
  \item Enemy \svg{unit_ranged} Units will always attack the Arrow Tower once there are no other \svg{unit_ranged} Units to attack.
  \item Enemy Units will always attack your Units if possible. Only when that is not possible, then the Gate,
    and then Walls will be attacked.
\end{itemize}

\textit{A large elvish population inhabits Erathia's southeastern coast.
Green and gold dragons, native to the region, augment their military strength.
Before we conquer this region, and detour our forces to Steadwick, we must annihilate these dragons.
Our Kreegan allies from Eeofol requested the honor of this mission.
The Kreegans are fierce warriors.
They will enjoy the slaughter.

\textbf{Introduction}

Our underlings have done well.
They have managed to raise a volcano and erect a fort in a sparsely populated forest just outside of Erathia's border.
While the Dungeon Overlords make their way underground toward the Erathian capitol, you must strike at their allies, the elves of AvLee.

\textbf{The Queen}

The Gold Dragon Queen is a powerful ally of AvLee.
You must find her lair and see to her demise, as this will greatly weaken the elves and make them less of a threat to our plans to destroy Erathia.
Go now, and make us proud!

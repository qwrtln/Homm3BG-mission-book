\textit{A large elvish population inhabits Erathia's southeastern coast.
  Green and gold dragons, native to the region, augment their military strength.
  Before we conquer this region and redirect our forces to Steadwick, we must annihilate these dragons.
  Our Kreegan allies from Eeofol have requested the honor of this mission.
  The Kreegans are fierce warriors; they will relish the slaughter.}

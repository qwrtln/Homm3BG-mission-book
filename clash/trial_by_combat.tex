\textit{There is no honor — only victory or death. The weak will fall, the strong will fight, and only one will rule.}

\subsection*{\MakeUppercase{Scenario Length}}
This Scenario plays out over 8-10 Rounds.

\subsection*{\MakeUppercase{Player Setup}}
\textbf{Player Count:} 2 -- 4

\textbf{Starting Resources:} 15 \svg{gold}, 2 \svg{building_materials}, 1 \svg{valuables}

\textbf{Starting Income:} 10 \svg{gold}, 2 \svg{building_materials}, 1 \svg{valuables}

\textbf{Starting Units:}
\begin{itemize}
  \item A ``Few'' cheapest \svg{silver} Units
  \item A chosen Neutral \svg{bronze} Unit matching the player's Faction
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Town Buildings:} \svg{bronze} Dwelling, Mage Guild

\subsection*{\MakeUppercase{Map Setup}}
Take the following Map Tiles and arrange them as shown in the Scenario map layout ($P$ stands for the number of players):

\begin{itemize}
  \item P × Starting (I) Map Tile
  \item 2P × Far (II-III) Map Tiles
  \item P × Near (IV-V) Map Tiles with Obelisk adjacent to Center Map Tile
  \item P × Near (IV-V) Map Tiles without Obelisk
  \item 1 × Center Map Tile. The center Field is ``The Hill''
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{\MakeUppercase{Victory Condition}}
When any player first flags ``The Hill'', each player, including the one who flagged it, gets two more full turns. After all players have completed their turns, the game ends, and the player who controls ``The Hill'' at that time wins. However, if ``The Hill'' has not been flagged by the start of Round 9, the first player to flag it during or after Round 9 immediately wins the game.

\subsection*{\MakeUppercase{Timed Events}}
\textbf{\nth{1} Round:}
\begin{itemize}
  \item All Heroes gain +1 \svg{movement}.
\end{itemize}
\textbf{\nth{2} Round:}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Players may gain 10 \svg{gold}, 4 \svg{building_materials} or 2 \svg{valuables}.
\end{itemize}
\textbf{\nth{4} Round:}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Remove all Black Cubes from every Windmill, Water Wheel, Mystical Garden, Camp Fire and Pandora's Box.
\end{itemize}
\textbf{\nth{7} Round:}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Repeat the Timed Event of Round 4.
\end{itemize}
\textbf{\nth{8} Round:}
\begin{itemize}
  \item All Heroes gain +1 \svg{movement}.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{\MakeUppercase{Additional Rules}}
\begin{itemize}
  \item All players gain income every Round.
  \item The blocked Field on the Center Map Tile is a Magic Spring and does not count as blocked.
  \item All Fields on the Center Map Tile are visitable once per Faction.
  \item Players do not lose \svg{gold} for losing or retreating from any Combat.
  \item After winning a combat against another player’s Main Hero or Level VII Neutrals, you may recruit or reinforce one of your Units that was defeated (reduced to 0 hitpoints) during the battle, at no cost.
  \item \textbf{Obelisk:} You may spawn your defeated Main Hero on an Obelisk you have flagged. \textit{Flaggable for all players.}
  \item \textit{Optional:} At the beginning of each Round, roll two Attack Dice separately and apply the effect from the table below.
\end{itemize}

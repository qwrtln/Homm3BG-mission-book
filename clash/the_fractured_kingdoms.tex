\textit{A terrible Armageddon has stricken the lands. Five rulers have found their kingdoms broken and torn apart, but after some time has past, they found their lands have drifted in the magic-laden space of this universe to collide with 4 other kingdoms. All 5 recognize that their first priority must be to rebuild and regrow, and they make a 5-kingdom alliance. However, each also knows in the back of their minds that whoever would break the alliance first, would gain a sharp first-strike advantage...}
